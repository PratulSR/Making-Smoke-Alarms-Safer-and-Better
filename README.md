# Making-Smoke-Alarms-Safer-and-Better

This report determines the best machine learning algorithm for a smoke alarm by using a smoke
alarm dataset to train and test many different models and analysing them on a set of methods of
performance. Today’s smoke alarms have a high rate of failure, including raising false alarms
and also failing to detect real instances of fire. These false alarms are a huge waste of fire
department resources and also impact public trust in the effectiveness of fire alarms.

After performing initial data pre-processing on the dataset acquired, different machine
learning models were trained on a subset of this data and then tested and measured by their
accuracies and number of false negatives. Both the weighted (WNN) and unweighted (KNN)
versions of the KNN model were found to be the best models since they had near-perfect
accuracies and number of false negatives. This incredible accuracy suggests that the KNN
model can distinguish between positive and negative cases quite precisely, thus providing a
sense of security that it is very well suited to handle features that affect the decision-making
process of a smoke alarm. No other model even came close to the extraordinary results that
KNN produced.

There is an opportunity in the Smoke Alarm market for newer, more affordable and more
accurate smoke alarms which can be digitally powered by our KNN/WNN machine learning
models. These alarms would be readily upgradable through improvements in the technology,
unlike today’s traditional alarms. As a major potential commercialisation opportunity, these
alarms can be pitched to leading smoke alarm manufacturing companies like ABB & Bosch.
